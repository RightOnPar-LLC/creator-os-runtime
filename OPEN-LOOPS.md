# Open work — runtime tool receipts

## IN PROGRESS: runtime routing and receipts (codex:tool-receipts, claim 538)

Canonical status, evidence, unfinished items, resume steps and agent responses:
[docs/specs/tool-receipts.md](docs/specs/tool-receipts.md).

Branch feat/runtime-tool-receipts; local checkout details are in the private shared handoff.
First boundary READY FOR REVIEW; source/artifact suites 314/0 and three negative controls verified.
Implemented locally and tested: runtime MCP + authenticated HTTP receipt boundary,
scoped lookup, failure/denial semantics. Not merged, deployed or live-proven.
Still not built: external MCP/gatehouse/runtime correlation and local executor
adapters. Direct tool calls still bypass the runtime. Next: file the reviewed branch, verify CI, then merge/deploy/live proof and missing adapters. No user approval pending for local
implementation/review work. Read the status document before continuing.
